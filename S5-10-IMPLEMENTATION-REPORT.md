# S5-10 Implementation Report: Coursework→Lesson Linkback & Progress Hooks

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive coursework-lesson linkback system enabling teachers and guardians to link coursework items to lessons for integrated progress tracking and mastery calculation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API (lesson-registry-svc)

**Models & Database**

- `CourseworkLink` model with full relationship management
- Proper indexing for performance (coursework_id, lesson_id, learner_id)
- Soft delete support for audit trails
- Mastery weight and difficulty adjustment parameters

**API Endpoints**

- `POST /linkback` - Create coursework-lesson links with RBAC validation
- `GET /linkback/coursework/{id}/links` - Retrieve links with learner scope filtering
- `DELETE /linkback/links/{id}` - Soft delete links with proper authorization
- Full error handling and validation

**Schemas**

- `CourseworkLinkRequest` - Input validation with Pydantic
- `CourseworkLinkResponse` - Structured response format
- `LinkbackStatus` - Operation status tracking
- `ProgressHookEvent` - Event emission schema

### 2. Analytics Integration (analytics-svc)

**Progress Hooks**

- `CourseworkProgressHook` class for signal processing
- Automatic progress tracking initialization on link creation
- Mastery curve adjustment based on coursework completion
- Weighted scoring with difficulty adjustments

**Event Processing**

- `COURSEWORK_LINKED` event listener for setup
- `COURSEWORK_COMPLETED` event listener for score integration
- Automatic mastery aggregate updates
- Privacy-aware analytics aggregation

### 3. Frontend Integration (apps/web)

**UI Components**

- "Link to Lesson" action button for coursework items
- Modal interface for lesson selection and linking
- Linked lessons display with management controls
- Real-time updates after link operations

**API Client Extensions**

- `searchLessons()` method with subject/grade filtering
- `createCourseworkLink()` with full payload support
- `getCourseworkLinks()` with learner scope handling
- `deleteCourseworkLink()` for unlink operations

### 4. Orchestrator Integration

**Event Listeners**

- `COURSEWORK_LINKED` → `PROGRESS_UPDATED` event chain
- `COURSEWORK_UNLINKED` → cleanup event propagation
- `COURSEWORK_COMPLETED` → mastery update triggers
- Cross-service notification coordination

## RBAC Implementation

**Role Requirements**

- Teacher role required for link creation/deletion
- Guardian role with learner scope validation
- Student role blocked from linkback operations
- Proper permission checking at API level

**Learner Scope Validation**

- Optional learner_id parameter for targeted links
- Query filtering by learner scope when specified
- Cross-learner access prevention
- Privacy-compliant data handling

## Progress Hook Architecture

**Signal Merging**

```
Coursework Completion → Weighted Score → Lesson Mastery Update
Score * (mastery_weight/100) * (1 + difficulty_adjustment/100)
```

**Mastery Calculation**

- Base score from coursework completion
- Weight adjustment (0-100% contribution)
- Difficulty modifier (-100% to +100%)
- Integrated with existing lesson progress signals

**Analytics Pipeline**

1. Link creation → Progress tracking initialization
2. Coursework completion → Score calculation & adjustment
3. Mastery aggregate update → Curve recalculation
4. Recommendation engine update → Personalized suggestions

## Testing Coverage

**Unit Tests**

- API endpoint validation and error handling
- RBAC authorization testing
- Progress hook signal processing
- Mastery calculation accuracy

**Integration Tests**

- End-to-end linkback workflow
- Event emission and processing
- Cross-service communication
- Database transaction integrity

**E2E Tests**

- Frontend linkback modal functionality
- Teacher/guardian workflow testing
- Error handling and recovery
- RBAC enforcement validation

## Performance Considerations

**Database Optimization**

- Composite indexes on (coursework_id, lesson_id)
- Learner-scoped indexes for filtering
- Soft delete patterns for audit trails
- Query optimization for large datasets

**Caching Strategy**

- Linked lessons cached per coursework item
- Available lessons cached with TTL
- Mastery aggregates cached for performance
- Event processing with background queues

## Security Implementation

**Data Protection**

- Learner PII handling with privacy controls
- RBAC enforcement at multiple layers
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

**Access Control**

- Teacher/guardian role validation
- Learner scope boundary enforcement
- Cross-tenant isolation
- API rate limiting

## Monitoring & Observability

**Metrics**

- Link creation/deletion rates
- Progress hook processing latency
- Mastery calculation accuracy
- Error rates by operation type

**Logging**

- Structured logging for all operations
- Event processing audit trails
- Performance metric collection
- Error tracking and alerting

**Health Checks**

- API endpoint health monitoring
- Event listener status verification
- Database connection health
- Cross-service communication checks

## Future Enhancements

**Advanced Features**

- Batch linkback operations for efficiency
- Custom mastery weight UI controls
- Progress visualization dashboards
- Automated link suggestions

**Analytics Improvements**

- Machine learning for optimal weights
- Predictive mastery modeling
- Advanced progress correlation analysis
- Personalized difficulty adjustments

**UI/UX Enhancements**

- Drag-and-drop link creation
- Bulk operations interface
- Progress visualization widgets
- Mobile-optimized linkback workflows

## Deployment Notes
