# Content Moderation & Safety Policy Matrix

## üõ°Ô∏è S4-12 ‚Äî Subject-Aware Safety Filters

**GOAL**: Expand moderation in `inference-gateway-svc` with **subject-aware** rules (K-12 appropriateness), SEL sensitivity, and block lists.

### üìã Overview

This document defines the comprehensive safety policy matrix for AIVO's content moderation system, featuring grade-band appropriate filtering, subject-aware rules, and Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) sensitivity detection.

### üéØ Key Features

- **Grade-Band Appropriateness**: Different moderation thresholds for K-5, 6-8, 9-12, and Adult education
- **Subject-Aware Rules**: Context-sensitive moderation based on academic subject
- **SEL Sensitivity**: Automatic escalation for social-emotional learning concerns
- **Guardian/Teacher Notifications**: Automated alerts for concerning content
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for blocked/flagged content

### üìä Grade Band Classification

| Grade Band     | Ages         | Description                                    | Moderation Level |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Elementary** | K-5 (5-10)   | Strict content filtering with immediate blocks | **STRICT**       |
| **Middle**     | 6-8 (11-13)  | Moderate filtering with teacher review         | **MODERATE**     |
| **High**       | 9-12 (14-18) | Relaxed filtering with warnings and audits     | **RELAXED**      |
| **Adult**      | 18+          | Minimal restrictions for adult education       | **MINIMAL**      |

### üîç Content Severity Levels

| **MINOR_CONCERN** | Mild concern, may need review        | Warn           |
| **MODERATE**      | Requires attention/filtering         | Filter         |
| **SEVERE**        | Block immediately                    | Block          |

### üîß Implementation Notes

#### Provider Integration

```python
# Example usage in inference gateway
safety_engine = SafetyEngine(config)

result = await safety_engine.moderate_content(
    content="Student's question or response",
    subject=Subject.MATH,
    grade_band=GradeBand.ELEMENTARY,
    user_id="student_123",
    tenant_id="school_456"
)

if result.action == ModerationAction.BLOCK:
    return {"error": "Content not appropriate for grade level"}
elif result.requires_escalation:
    await notify_guardians_and_teachers(result)
```

#### Custom Rule Addition

```python
# Adding custom moderation rules
custom_rule = ModerationRule(
    name="chemistry_safety",
    description="Block dangerous chemistry references",
    grade_bands=[GradeBand.ELEMENTARY, GradeBand.MIDDLE],
    subjects=[Subject.SCIENCE],
    blocked_keywords=["explosive", "toxic", "poisonous"],
    action=ModerationAction.BLOCK,
    audit_log=True
)

safety_engine.add_custom_rule(custom_rule)
```

### üìû Emergency Procedures

#### Immediate Response Protocol

1. **Critical SEL Detection**: Automatic notification within 5 minutes
2. **Violence Threats**: Immediate blocking + school admin alert
3. **Self-Harm Indicators**: Guardian + counselor notification
4. **System Failures**: Fail-safe to most restrictive mode

#### Escalation Chain

1. **Tier 1**: Automated filtering/blocking
2. **Tier 2**: Teacher notification and review
3. **Tier 3**: Guardian notification + counselor involvement
4. **Tier 4**: School administration + emergency services
