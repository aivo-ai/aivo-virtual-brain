- **Progress tracking** and performance metrics
- **Responsive design** with proper scaling

#### 4. Game HUD Component (`apps/web/src/components/game/Hud.tsx`)

- **Timer display** with formatted time
- **Score tracking** with current and maximum scores
- **Progress bar** showing scene completion
- **Pause/resume controls** with keyboard shortcuts
- **Game information** display (title, scene indicator)
- **Responsive layout** for different screen sizes

#### 5. Results Sheet Component (`apps/web/src/components/game/ResultSheet.tsx`)

- **Performance metrics** display (score, accuracy, time, interactions)
- **Grade calculation** with letter grades (A+ to F)
- **Achievement system** with performance-based achievements
- **Detailed statistics** breakdown
- **Action buttons** for retry and home navigation
- **Animated presentation** with Framer Motion

## Usage Examples

### Basic Game Launch

```typescript
// Navigate to game player
router.push("/game/play?topic=math&difficulty=easy&duration=300");
```

### Custom Game Loading

```typescript
// Load specific game
router.push("/game/play?gameId=existing-game-123");
```

### API Integration

```typescript
// Generate and start game
const gameResponse = await gameClient.generateGame({
  topic: "mathematics",
