### 7. Frontend Components

**File**: `apps/web/src/components/authoring/TeacherContentAuthoring.tsx`

React-based authoring interface with:

- **Block-based Editor**: Visual content creation with 10+ block types
- **Asset Library**: Drag-and-drop file uploads with preview
- **Publishing Interface**: One-click publish with approval workflow
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time validation and completion status
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly authoring experience

**Key UI Features**:

- Real-time draft saving
- Asset upload with progress indicators
- Content block management (add, edit, reorder, delete)
- Learning objectives editor

- Validation error display

### 8. Schema Definitions

**File**: `services/lesson-registry-svc/app/schemas/authoring.py`

Comprehensive Pydantic schemas with validation:

- Content block schemas with type validation
- Draft management request/response models
- Asset upload and management schemas
- Publishing workflow schemas
- Review and translation request schemas
- Batch operation support

## Technical Architecture

### Content Block System

Flexible JSON-based content blocks supporting:

```json
{
  "id": "block_123",
  "type": "text",
  "content": { "text": "Lesson content here" },
  "order": 1,
  "metadata": { "style": "emphasized" }
}
```

Supported block types:

- **text**: Rich text content
- **heading**: H1-H6 with hierarchy
- **image**: Images with alt text and captions
- **video**: Video embeds with metadata
- **audio**: Audio clips with controls
- **quiz**: Interactive assessments
- **code**: Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- **embed**: External content integration
- **file**: Document attachments
- **interactive**: Custom interactive components

### Asset Management

Three-tier asset storage:

1. **Temporary**: Draft assets in S3 with expiration
2. **Processing**: Asset optimization and validation
3. **Permanent**: Published assets with CDN distribution

### Approval Workflow

Multi-stage approval process:

1. **Teacher Creation**: Draft with auto-validation
2. **Content Review**: Subject matter expert review
3. **Accessibility Review**: Compliance validation
4. **Curriculum Alignment**: Standards verification
5. **Final Approval**: Publishing authorization

### Translation Pipeline

AI-assisted workflow:

1. **Content Extraction**: Parse content blocks for translation
2. **AI Translation**: Inference Gateway integration
3. **Human Review**: Expert validation and cultural adaptation
