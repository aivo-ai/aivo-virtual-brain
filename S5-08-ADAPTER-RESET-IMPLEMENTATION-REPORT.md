# S5-08 Adapter Reset Implementation Report

## Overview

Successfully implemented the **Adapter Reset** feature (S5-08) that allows learners to reset their per-subject AI brain personas through an approval-based workflow. This feature enables fresh starts when learners are struggling or want to begin with a clean slate while maintaining audit trails and safety guardrails.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API (Private FM Orchestrator)

#### Reset Request Endpoints

- **POST `/api/v1/reset`** - Create new adapter reset request
- **GET `/api/v1/reset/{request_id}/status`** - Check reset status
- **POST `/api/v1/reset/webhook/approval-decision`** - Handle approval decisions

#### Core Functionality

- **Per-subject reset**: Targets specific subjects (math, reading, science, etc.)
- **Approval workflow**: Integrates with approval service for guardian consent
- **Execution tracking**: Real-time progress monitoring with stages
- **Event replay**: Rebuilds model by replaying learner's event history
- **Audit logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance

### 2. Database Schema

#### New `adapter_reset_requests` Table

```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- learner_id: UUID (Foreign Key)
- subject: String (Subject to reset)
- reason: Text (Reason for reset)
- requested_by: UUID (Requester ID)
- requester_role: String (guardian, teacher, learner)
- status: Enum (pending_approval, approved, executing, completed, failed)
- approval_request_id: UUID (Links to approval service)
- progress_percent: Integer (0-100)
- current_stage: String (Reset stage description)
- events_replayed: Integer (Count of events processed)
- timestamps: created_at, started_at, completed_at
- metadata: JSON (Additional execution data)
```

#### Enhanced `event_logs` Table

- Added `subject` column for per-subject filtering
- Added `timestamp` column for proper event ordering during replay

### 3. Approval Workflow Integration

#### Guardian Approval Process

- **Auto-approval** for guardian requests
- **Approval required** for teacher/learner requests
- **Permission checking** via permissions service
- **Webhook integration** for approval decisions
- **Timeout handling** for approval workflow

#### Approval Request Payload

```json
{
  "type": "ADAPTER_RESET",
  "resource_id": "learner_id",
  "subject": "math",
  "requested_by": "teacher_id",
  "requester_role": "teacher",
  "reason": "Student struggling with concepts",
  "metadata": {
    "subject": "math",
    "reset_request_id": "uuid"
  },
  "callback_url": "/api/private-fm-orchestrator/reset/webhook/approval-decision"
}
```

### 4. Reset Execution Engine

#### Multi-Stage Reset Process

1. **Validation** - Verify request and permissions
2. **Adapter Deletion** - Remove existing subject-specific model
3. **Base Model Cloning** - Create fresh foundation model copy
4. **Event Replay** - Rebuild model using historical learning events
5. **Finalization** - Update status and emit completion events

#### NamespaceIsolator Integration

```python
# New methods added to isolator
async def delete_subject_adapter(learner_id, subject)
async def clone_base_model_for_subject(learner_id, subject)
async def replay_event(learner_id, subject, event)
```

### 5. Frontend Components

#### BrainPersona Component Features

- **Visual brain personas** for each subject with icons and colors
- **Adaptation level indicators** (Novice → Developing → Proficient → Advanced)
- **Performance metrics** (accuracy, improvement, concepts mastered)
- **Reset status tracking** with progress indicators
- **Reset request buttons** with approval status

#### ResetDialog Component

- **Clear explanation** of reset consequences
- **Approval process information** for transparency
- **Reason input** for audit trail
- **Timeline expectations** for user guidance
- **Warning alerts** about data loss

### 6. Real-time Status Updates

#### Progress Tracking

- **Stage-based progress** (Initializing, Deleting, Cloning, Replaying, Finalizing)
- **Percentage completion** (0-100%)
- **Events replayed counter** for transparency
- **Error handling** with detailed error messages
- **Estimated completion time** based on event count

#### Status Monitoring

```typescript
interface ResetStatus {
  request_id: string;
  status: "pending_approval" | "executing" | "completed" | "failed";
  progress_percent: number;
  current_stage: string;
  events_replayed: number;
  estimated_completion: string;
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### Service Communication

```
Frontend → Private FM Orchestrator → Approval Service
                ↓
           Namespace Isolator → Model Storage
                ↓
           Event Log Replay → Foundation Model Training
```

### Data Flow

1. **Reset Request** - User submits request via frontend
2. **Validation** - Check permissions and namespace integrity
3. **Approval** - Route through approval service if needed
4. **Execution** - Execute reset via background task
5. **Monitoring** - Real-time status updates via polling
6. **Completion** - Notify user and update UI state

### Security & Compliance

- **Guardian approval** for all non-guardian requests
- **Permission checking** for teacher reset capabilities
- **Audit logging** for all reset operations
- **Request validation** to prevent unauthorized resets
- **Resource cleanup** to prevent data leaks

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors

- Namespace not found (404)
- Invalid subject (400)
- Pending reset conflict (409)
- Missing permissions (403)

### Execution Errors

- Adapter deletion failure
- Base model cloning failure
- Event replay errors
- Network/storage timeouts

### Recovery Mechanisms

- **Retry logic** for transient failures
- **Rollback procedures** for partial failures
- **Error notifications** to users and guardians
- **Manual intervention** triggers for support team

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Reset request validation
- Approval workflow logic
- Event replay functionality
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end reset workflow
- Approval service integration
- Database transaction integrity
- Frontend component behavior

### Load Tests

- Concurrent reset requests
- Large event log replay
- System resource usage
- Database performance

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

- **Background processing** for reset execution
- **Chunked event replay** to prevent memory issues
- **Database indexing** for efficient queries
- **Caching** for frequently accessed data

### Resource Management

- **Progress tracking** to monitor resource usage
- **Timeout handling** for long-running operations
- **Memory cleanup** after reset completion
- **Storage optimization** for model files

## Deployment & Monitoring

### Database Migration

```bash
# Apply new schema changes
alembic upgrade head
```

### Service Configuration

```yaml
# Environment variables
MAX_CONCURRENT_RESETS: 5
RESET_TIMEOUT_MINUTES: 15
EVENT_REPLAY_BATCH_SIZE: 100
APPROVAL_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT: 30
```

### Monitoring Metrics

- Reset request rate
- Approval processing time
- Reset execution duration
- Success/failure rates
- Event replay performance

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Selective replay** - Only replay specific event types
2. **Reset scheduling** - Allow delayed execution
3. **Batch resets** - Reset multiple subjects simultaneously
4. **Model comparison** - Compare before/after performance
5. **Auto-reset triggers** - Automatic resets based on performance degradation

### API Extensions

- Reset analytics dashboard
- Bulk reset operations
- Reset impact analysis
