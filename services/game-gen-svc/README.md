# AIVO Game Generation Service (S2-13)

**Dynamic reset game generation with AI personalization**

The Game Generation Service creates personalized, educational reset games tailored to individual learner profiles. It generates engaging, time-bound activities that help students take mental breaks while reinforcing learning objectives.

## üéÆ Overview

- **Duration Management**: Respects requested timeframes (1-60 minutes) with attention span considerations
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Emits `GAME_READY` and `GAME_COMPLETED` events for orchestrator integration
- **Quality Assurance**: Validates game manifests with quality scoring and duration compliance

### Game Types Supported

- **Puzzle Games**: Pattern solving, logic challenges
- **Memory Games**: Recall and recognition activities
- **Word Games**: Vocabulary, language skills
- **Math Games**: Arithmetic, problem solving
- **Creative Games**: Art, music, storytelling
- **Mindfulness Games**: Relaxation, focus activities
